    <p class="normaltext" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
        Let's say you're an aspiring game designer and developer with a game idea
        and the ability to program it, but your artistic ability is very limited.
        Start your project with SGDG to find others who share your interests and
        have that missing ability and interest in graphics design. Or, maybe
        you're someone with an idea for an app but don't have the ability to make
        it. Find someone through SGDG to team up with and turn your idea into
        something real.
    </p>

    <p class="largethicctext">
        Get the recognition your personal projects deserve.
    </p>

    <p class="normaltext" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
        It's sometimes really demotivating to make something cool only for no one
        to see, use, or play it. Build a portfolio with SGDG to grow a userbase.
    </p>

    <p class="largethicctext">
        Personal projects are cool, but we're more than just that.
    </p>

    <p class="normaltext">
        Form SGDG "sponsored" teams for hackathons, game jams, or other relevant
        events and competitions. We could even end up hosting some of our own.
