                    Let's say you're an aspiring game designer and developer with a game idea
                    and the ability to program it, but your artistic ability is very limited.
                    Start your project with SGDG to find others who share your interests and
                    have that missing ability and interest in graphics design. Or, maybe
                    you're someone with an idea for an app but don't have the ability to make
                    it. Find someone through SGDG to team up with and turn your idea into
                    something real.
