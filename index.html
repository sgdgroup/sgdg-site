    <p class="normaltext" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
        Let's say you're an aspiring game designer and developer with a game idea
        and the ability to program it, but your artistic ability is very limited.
        Start your project with SGDG to find others who share your interests and
        have that missing ability and interest in graphics design. Or, maybe
        you're someone with an idea for an app but don't have the ability to make
        it. Find someone through SGDG to team up with and turn your idea into
        something real.
    </p>

    <p class="largethicctext">
        Get the recognition your personal projects deserve.
    </p>

    <p class="normaltext" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">
        It's sometimes really demotivating to make something cool only for no one
        to see, use, or play it. Build a portfolio with SGDG to grow a userbase.

            After
            <a href="/join">becoming a member</a>
            of SGDG, be sure to check your email for the latest news, projects,
            events, and any other participation opportunity. You can use
            <a href="/search">Search</a>
            to find everything SGDG - people with certain skills to start a
            project with, open projects to join, projects in need of testing or
            use, and more.
            <br><br>
            Because SGDG is brand new, many of its logistics are still being
            figured out. Please let us know if you have any good ideas.

        I don't have any experience in any of these things. Can I still join?

    <div class="innercontent">
        <p>
            Definitely! SGDG is open to everyone regardless of their experience
            levels. If you have an interest in tech and computer content
            development, you're welcome to join. You'll have plenty of
            opportunities to learn through hands-on development work and through
            others who have more experience.

        None of the types of developers listed really apply to me. Should I
        still join?

            You'd probably enjoy being a member of SGDG if you have any sort of
            interest in technology or electronic entertainment. If you're still
            not sure if SGDG is right for you, you should contact us.
