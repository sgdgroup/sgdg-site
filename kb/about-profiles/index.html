                <p>Your SGDG Profile is a way for you to share your interests, projects, experience, contact info, and more with others. It'll allow those looking for people to join their projects to learn about you, as well as know how to contact you.</p>
                <p>You can also use your profile to share some of your projects that you're working on, so those that come across your page can learn about the opportunity and know how to contact you.</p>
                <p>Check out the profiles of others through <a href="/search">SGDG Search</a> (select the 'People' box and search by name, interest, etc., or type 'all' to list all members). Feel free to check out <a href="/u/dilan">mine</a> if you want an example of what a complete profile looks like.</p>
