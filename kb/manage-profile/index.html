            <div class="kb-article-section">
                <p class="h">Access</p>
                <p>Once you've <a href="/kb/create-profile">created your SGDG Profile</a>, you can access it by clicking the 'Person' icon on the right side of the navigation bar at the top of this website. If your session expired, log in with your Northwestern Google account to return to your profile editing page.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="kb-article-section">
                <p class="h">The About section</p>
                <p>The <strong>Short Description</strong> field is a short, one-line description that appears on your search card in SGDG Search. Perhaps use this to share your primary interests and skills. For example, 'Desktop and web application developer', 'Game designer and artist', 'Music and sound designer', etc.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Description</strong> field is a longer description section that appears only on your full profile page. Go all out here. Be detailed and share as much information as you want about your interests, experience, and more (enough to let people know about you and your interests but not too much that people don't want to read it all).</p>
                <p>The <strong>Gravatar Email</strong> field is how you'll implement your profile picture. If you already know what Gravatar is and have an account already with your preferred profile picture, enter your account's email address here. Otherwise, make a <a href="https://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> account and add your profile picture to it, then enter its email.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Skills and Interests</strong> section is pretty important, since it allows others to see what your interests and specialties are when looking for people to join projects. If you select 'Game Design', for example, people will know you have an interest in game design and know to contact you if they're looking for a game designer to join their project. These skills and interests will be displayed on both your search card and on your profile page. People can also find you by <a href="/kb/search">searching by interest/skill</a> with SGDG Search.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="kb-article-section">
                <p class="h">The Web Presence section</p>
                <p>Here's where you can share your contact info and social media with others. You can provide places for people to contact you if they're interested in working with you, as well as portfolios to share some of your past work if you have any.</p>
                <p>All fields are optional. Leaving any of the web presence fields blank will hide it from your profile. <strong>Don't enter full URLs, just your usernames</strong> (other than for your website if you're including one). The web presence cards on your profile page will automatically create the URL with your username for that site.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="kb-article-section">
                <p class="h">The Extra Stuff section</p>
                <p>This section serves as a place for people to learn more about the way you use a computer and what your development environment looks like. These fields are also all optional, so only the ones you fill out will appear on your profile page.</p>
                <p>Take the 'Favorite IDE' field, for example. Since you'll most likely be collaborating with others when working on your projects, letting others know what your favorite IDE is could let them know what you're good at using, potentially encouraging them to use the same one when working with you.</p>
                <p>These fields don't require you to limit yourself to one answer or anything. They're normal text boxes, so you can write multiple answers, add descriptions, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="kb-article-section">
                <p class="h">Things you can't really change</p>
                <p>Things like your full name and username (and other things tied to you that don't appear on your profile edit page) can't be changed by you. If you'd like any of that to be changed, contact us.</p>

                <p>If you have suggestions for more web presence options or extra stuff questions, let us know! We'd love to include more.</p>
