                    <li>Visit the <a href="https://portal.sgdgroup.org">SGDG Portal</a>.</li>
                    <li>If you don't already have an active session, you'll be prompted to log in to continue. <strong>You'll need to log in with your Northwestern Google account.</strong></li>
                    <li>You'll then be prompted to enter a username for SGDG. This is a lowercase alphanumeric no-space username primarily for your SGDG Profile URL. To keep things simple, it's recommended that you try just your first name. If it says it's taken, you can try appending your last initial or last name or something. Don't make it something dumb though or we'll remove it.</li>
                    <li>That's it! Your profile page will be automatically created. Visit your <a href="https://portal.sgdgroup.org/profile">profile editor</a> to finish setting up your profile.</li>

                <p class="h">View</p>
                <p>Now that you've setup your account, you and anyone else can access it at sgdgroup.org/u/yourUsername. It'll also appear in SGDG Search. You should appear in search results immediately, but it may take a few minutes for your profile page to prepare (until it's ready, it'll just say page not found).</p>
